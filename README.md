My WCF Data Services Demo

WCF Data Services (Windows Communication Foundation)
My WCF Data Services Demo: 

Open Data Protocol (OData) is an open protocol which allows the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable RESTful APIs in a simple and standard way. This application uses the following technologies: OData, WCF, Entity Framework, IIS Express Web Server, SQL Server, etc. This is an empty web application that uses OData and WCF Data Services to allow the user or web applications to query and consume data from a web server with a data service that is running a connection to Microsoft SQL Server using the Entity Framework model. The data is returned in XML format but the user can also query and consume JSON format by modifying their query syntax. 

Comments: You need to install the Northwind database to an SQL Server instance on your computer or server, then modify the application's connection string to connect to your unique server SQL database instance. Also, this application was developed for demo only and runs using the the IIS Express for local windows autenticated users. You will need to configure your professional IIS webserver to properly present to the world.
